# C++ project template
My own C++ project template for Windows and Linux. It is simple and ready to compile and run :).

## Intructions
1. Copy the repo url, then go to your favorite terminal emulator and paste the command `git clone https://github.com/Bubbr/cpp-project-template` and run.
2. Run the comamnd `./build -run` and if everything is ok it should show the message `Hello world` in the console.
3. Finally you can remove the `README.md` and `.gitignore` files and the `.git` folder.

**Final note**: If you want a custom structure you can change it in the `build.ps1` file.

## TODO
- [] Accept third party libraries into the `build` script.
- [] Create template for linux.
